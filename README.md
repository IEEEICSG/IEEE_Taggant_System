IEEE_Taggant_System
===================

Taggant System developed by the Malware Working Group of ICSG (Industry Connections Security Group) under the umbrella of IEEE

Taggant System
The Taggant System places a cryptographically secure marker in the packed and obfuscated files created by commercial
software distribution packaging programs (packers). Legitimate packers are often abused by malware creators to create 
many, difficult-to-detect variants of their malware. The Taggant System markers identify the specific packer user's
license key, used to create an instance of packed malware. That packer user can then be blacklisted, and all files
created by that packer user will be reported as suspicious in the Taggant System.
