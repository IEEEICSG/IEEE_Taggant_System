*1 - overlay is defined as any bytes, other than a v2 Taggant or digital signature, that exist beyond the non-zero value that was specified by the uFileEnd parameter of the TaggantComputeHashes() function.
*2 - the validity of the digital signature is not checked, only that the Taggant can be located in the presence of the DS.
